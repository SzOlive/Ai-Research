## Project Overview

This repository contains study notes and implementations of core Machine Learning and Deep Learning models as part of a guided AI research project.

The objective is to build strong fundamentals by:

* Understanding the theory behind each model
* Implementing models from scratch or with minimal abstraction
* Practicing with small datasets
* Documenting results and observations

The focus is on **conceptual clarity and practical implementation** using **PyTorch**.
