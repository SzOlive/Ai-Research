# AI Research Project – Image Track

**Name:** Shadman Zaman Olive 
**Department:** ECE
**Project Type:** AI Research (Image Domain)
**Framework:** PyTorch

## Project Overview

This repository contains my study notes and implementations for core Machine Learning and Deep Learning models as part of a guided AI research project.

The goal is to understand each model conceptually and implement it using **PyTorch**, focusing on practical understanding rather than heavy library usage.

---

## My Topics (Image Track)

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Transfer Learning
3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
4. Vision Transformer (ViT)
5. Multimodal Large Language Models

* PyTorch implementations
* Results and visualizations

---

## Tools Used

* Python
* PyTorch
* Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)
* Git & GitHub

---

## Study Approach

For each model:

1. Study core theory
2. Implement model in PyTorch
3. Test on a small dataset
4. Document results in a notebook
5. Push progress to GitHub
